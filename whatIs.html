    <div class="explain">

        <p>Multiple Sclerosis in an autoimmune system that affects the nervous system. Your immune system 
            attacks the myelin coating on your nerve fibers. Myelin is the substance that surrounds and
             protects your nerve fibers. Losing myelin causes scar tissue, and those areas are lesions. 
             These lesions cover the brain and spinal cord. This can cause symptoms like vision loss,
              tingling and numbness sensations, or vision impairment. Multiple Sclerosis can be diagnosed with MRI scans, Lumbar puncture, 
            blood test, optical coherence tomography, evoked potential tests, neuropsychological testing.</p>
