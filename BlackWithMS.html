        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is often unnoticed or not properly diagnosed with African Americans. MS was originally thought to be more present in White populations, but that was not the case.
             This is due to the lack of African America representation in MS studies. 
        </p>     
        <p>
            Multiple Sclerosis may look different in Black patients. Their disease progression may be faster, a greater risk of disability, 
            or develop MS later in life.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            African American representation in MS studies is important. Reasearch disparities in African American patients may cause a delay in diagnosis or lead to an improper diagnosis. This can cause a disadvantage for Black patients 
            because they are not presenting with the same symptoms as White patients with MS.  
        </p>

       <h2>How to Navigate</h2>

       <p>Black patients with MS may find it more difficult to talk with their doctors about their disease. Black patients often have 
        to learn how to navigate through the healthcare system
        without feeling anxious or unheard about their issues.  </p>

        <p> Some ways they can are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Educating themselves about MS</li>
                <li> Documenting their symptoms</li>
                <li> Advocating for themselves</li>
            </ul>
        <p>As Black patients continue to navigate the health care system with their disease, it is important
            that they know how to. Black patients should always
            feel comfortable with ther physicians and be able to share information about their diesease without
            feeling unheard.
