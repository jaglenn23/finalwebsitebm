        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is often gone unnoticed or not properly diagnosed with African Americans. MS was thought to be more present in White populations, but that was not the case.
             Lack of African American representation in MS studies is the reason behind this misconception.  
        </p>     
        <p>
            Multiple Sclerosis may look different in Black patients. Their disease progression may be faster, a greater risk of disability, 
            or develop MS later in life.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            Black American representation in MS studies is important. With the lack of MS research for African American patients, it may cause a delay for diagnosis or lead to an improper diagnosis. This can cause a disadvantage for Black patients, 
            because they are not presenting the same symptoms as White patients with MS.  
        </p>

       <h2>How to Navigate</h2>

       <p>Since Black patients with MS (diagnosed or undiagnosed) may find it more difficult to talk with their doctors about their disease. Black patients have 
        to learn how to navigate through the healthcare systems
        without feeling anxious or unheard about their issues.  </p>

        <p> Some ways they can are:</p>
            <ul class:ways>
                <li>Educating themselves about MS</li>
                <li> Documenting their Symptoms</li>
                <li> Advocating for themselves</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
