       <h1>About</h1>
        <p> Beautiful Minds was created to spread awareness about Black people that suffer from Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
            Research shows that more Black people live with MS than previously thought (National MS Society). 
            Beautiful Minds aims to push Black people with MS to advocate for their health and to educate themselves on what this disease does to their body. 
            We uphold Navigating Multiple Sclerosis Beautifully, which we hope will allow people with Multiple Sclerosis to live happier and healthier.

        <h2>Navigating MS</h2>
