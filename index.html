       <h1>About</h1>
        <p> Beautiful Minds was created to spread awareness about Black people that suffer from Multiple Sclerosis.
            Research shows that more Black people live with MS than previously thought (National MS Society). 
            Beautiful Minds aims to push Black people with MS to advocate for their health and to educate themselves on what this disease does to their body. 
            We uphold Navigating Multiple Sclerosis Beautifully, which we hope will allow people with Multiple Sclerosis to live happier and healthier.

        <p>The first stage to navigating your MS is learning what it is. 
            That could be learning what type of disease it is, what are the symptoms, or treatment options.
